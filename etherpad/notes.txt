Day 3 +
I love R markdown!
R markdown is great!
I can see the usefulness of R markdown but I found it very confusing, particularly as I'd never seen R before Monday.
 
Day 3 -
 
 
Day 2 +
It was clear, thank you - good to get information on mathematical models.
Great, it was much better and slower, did enjoy.
Thank you
The slower pace today with the scripts was alot better understood than yesterday
Slower is better
I kept up much better than yesterday - thanks
SO much better!!Thank you!I feel much more confident in R now...
Very convenient to have the different methods run in parallel to see differences in output and workflow.
Great explanation of models underlying the analyses and the importance and effect of the models.
Thanks for going slower on the tutorials - it really helps to have someone explain all the commands and the general workflow
tutorials at much better pace
Thank you for covering a lot of very useful information.
The practical examples help - thank you for the scripts
 
Day 2 -
I am a bit confused now
The mathematical models were very confusing and the general explanation of them went abit too fast to actually understand what they do
its now deeper 
I really need to go back to my stats books! I am rather confused with the mathematics.
I've never done any stats other than chi2 so the maths I found difficult
 
 
Day 1 +
Thanks very much for the willingness of helping
very informative, exciting to get started with this type of analysis
Real international heroes.
Worflows and scripts are not the usual handouts that are freely distributed. This kind of help rare to come by. 
Having the oportunity to ask question and take home the scripts can really speed up projects.
You have my genuine heartfelt THANK YOU
Lectures were informative and covered basic knowledge which I had previously been lacking. It was easy to follow but covered all relevant topics.
enlightening, especially the last session, the hands on.
Assistance
Your presentations were very clear, I now understand the general process
Perfect introduction to the work flow! Thank you!
Very informative (especially the section on normalization and the overall process)
Lots of valuable information. Much appreciated.
Thanks for the help.
Thanks, just right pace and detail level
Lectures were perfect speed
Lectures were a good pace and at an understandable level
I think that the lectures are at the correct pace, but it is clear that I need a better background in stats. 
 
Day 1 -
The presentation good but better synchronised with practical session
Good presentations, however is it possible to conduct the the presentations of each analysis then do the prac, stage by stage?
I feel that the sessions were slightly too fast for me as I do not fully understand but am getting there.
The practicals were a bit too fast for me, maybe going slowly through each command and what we are doing at each step would help. I am very new to all of this.
The practical is better to do on own, but need feedback on what happened.
the practical/tutorial was a bit fast and tough to folllow
The practical session was a bit confusing. I think it should be done in conjunction with the presentations (it may take long but I think it would help us understand better). 
More time is needed for the practical sessions
The practical session would be more informative if we could go through it together, with the lecturer explaining why we do certain steps. It's difficult to understand why we write certain codes without this guidance.

General overview to help me make sense and possibly re-analyze other researcher's RNA-seq data without their help (Specifically differential gene expression).
Learn how to analyze the single cell RNA-Seq data: icluding sample qc, and using R packages to do clustering and network analysis and any additional methods of single cell analysis. Also get some advice on noramilizing the single cell data.
An overview to enable me to advise others on whethere it is a suitable method to use for their research and also possible project design.
Statistical analysis and differential gene expression analysis
A better understanding of how RNA-seq data is generated and analysed in a differential gene expression analysis

More information on de novo assemblers? What about Bridger instead of Trinity? 
I don't know! I couldn't find an independent comparison of Bridger and Trinity, so it's difficult to know. In many cases, there would be considerable overlap between methods (e.g., edgeR and DESeq2 are very similar, but differ in what is reported)
 
 
    How best to pool samples for analysis biological vs technical studies
    Ideally, you can have some replicaton

https://www.rna-seqblog.com/researchers-discourage-sample-pooling-in-rna-seq-experiments/
 
How do you go about mapping pathways? What software do you use to map ? and to 
 
How can you use transcriptome data for gene finding, in the absence of genomic data?
Difficult!
https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1284-1
"The Lace software is provided to construct superTranscripts from any set of transcripts, including de novo assemblies."
 
 
    There are so many different programs with similar functions to analyze data, how do you decide which one to use?
- this is difficult also for us! Comes down to a combination of performance (can sometimes get this from benchmark studies), capabilities (some models/tools are more flexible), look-and-feel (user friendliness, usuability), responsiveness of the authors (e.g., Bioconductor support site)
 
 
Single cell analysis: whats is your opinion on normalizing the single cell data using spike-ins?
Opinion: would rather not use spike-ins (have seen studies where the use of spike-ins have been challenged: https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2931), but I wouldn't rule it out (they are controls!)
 
 
Single cell analysis: how do you handle the biological/ technical noice in the single cell data?
Many questions still not answered here, but lots of active development.
 
 
    How do you analyse mRNA half-life?
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202317302773
Determining mRNA half-lives on a transcriptome-wide scale
 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939777/
"We measured half-lives of 21,248 mRNA 3′ isoforms in yeast by rapidly depleting RNA polymerase II from the nucleus and performing direct RNA sequencing throughout the decay process."
 
 
 
How would you suggests to do troubleshooting in R? 
Sanity checks!
